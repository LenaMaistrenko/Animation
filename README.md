**Animations**

Clouds Animation

The clouds are animated to gently sway from side to side. The animation is achieved through the clouds and clouds-show keyframes.

Moon Animation

The moon undergoes a subtle rotation and has a glowing line that moves across its surface. This is accomplished using the moon and moon-line keyframes.
